# Week1 Challenge: Design a 3-Tier Architecture 🚀

For this task, your objective is to design a 3-tier architecture in a cloud platform, such as AWS, Azure, or GCP, with a focus on the following key considerations:

1. **High Availability**: Ensure your architecture is highly available, capable of withstanding failures, and can provide uninterrupted service.

2. **Scalability**: Design your architecture to be highly scalable, allowing for easy and efficient resource scaling as your application's demands increase.

3. **Fault Tolerance**: Implement fault-tolerant mechanisms to minimize downtime and service interruptions during failures.

4. **Custom VPC/VNET**: Consider using a custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for AWS or GCP, a Virtual Network (VNET) for Azure, or a similar network customization instead of relying on the default configurations.

5. **Security**: Prioritize security by adhering to best practices for Identity and Access Management (IAM) and implementing robust security measures.

Your design should address these considerations, resulting in a well-structured, efficient, and secure 3-tier architecture.
Feel free to leverage the capabilities of your chosen cloud platform to implement this architecture effectively.
